solutions 1a and 1b work

2b my solution would have required a dyanimc programming implementatiom to search the best way to factor the multiples so that it was under 41 with the least amount of values.

3 was a parse that I didn't think I had the runtime to do but turns out the runtime worked.

4-5 are just too hard for my current skill level
