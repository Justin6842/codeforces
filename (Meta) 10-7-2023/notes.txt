solutions 1a and 1b work

2b my solution would have required a dyanimc programming implementatiom to search the best way to factor the multiples so that it was under 41 with the least amount of values.

3 required a bitwise operations that I still haven't learned yet

4-5 are just too hard for my current skill level
